# ClaudeInstructions
## This repo only contains two template files, based on how I work with Claude Code or any AI-development tool (e.g. Cursor)

  ### ClaudeInstructions.md
- #### This is the summary of what I load into Claude.md
### How_to_plan_guide.md
- #### My point of reference for all AI development.  Before making any large changes, I ask the LLM to build out a plan from my conceptual discussions with it.  A solid plan lets me walk away while the coding happens.
